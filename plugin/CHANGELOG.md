# Changelog

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-11 - The Seam (design + working implementation)

- docs/2026-07-11-seam-design.md: the full ratified design (silent capture + soft
  report; first-of-day serving; seedlings w/ auto-expiry + archive + semantic search;
  hybrid mechanism-at-decay-points; mortality-aware capture).
- SERVER SHIPS (server/server.py, stdlib-only, 8/8 e2e tests): batch capture w/
  write-time near-duplicate detection, seedling->open touch graduation, serve ranking
  (beacons > territory > age-decay resurfacing), ranked search w/ keyword fallback,
  edit/re-parent w/ cycle guard, atomic conversion, TOCTOU-verified prune cascades,
  daily seedling expiry, seam-health + groom/calibration reports. Serves web/ static.
- WEB: search bar filters all three views (matches always labeled - search overrides
  the zoom budget; non-matches ghost to 13%), quick-add box, seedling visual state,
  seam-health strip. Verified live against the running server.
- SKILLS updated to the ratified policies; HOOKS scaffolded (SessionStart first-of-day
  card, Stop sweep, PreCompact mortality sweep) - validate on first real install.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-11 - Foundation

The repo's first real content, written the day after the prototype was born:

- README (the problem story + what it is), CHARTER (a garden, not an archive - the
  seven disciplines + the two-memory-architectures purpose statement).
- Plugin manifest + three skills: `topics-capture` (lazy growth, the capture
  threshold, the beacon), `topics-serve` (one card, never the list; the three exit
  doors incl. the explicit conversion moment), `topics-groom` (the recurring
  gardener's round; the metric that matters).
- Storage design: server/schema.sql (topic tree + conversion links + append-only
  event history) and server/README.md (one process, HTTP + MCP faces, the adapter
  law, client-confirmed server-verified prune cascades).
- web/prototype: verbatim snapshot of the four working view files from the birthplace
  instance + PORTING.md (the behavioral contract, owner-reacted, do-not-regress).
- ROADMAP: server -> single-module merge -> port -> capture UX -> serving -> first
  outside user.

Not yet runnable as a plugin; see INSTALL.md for the intended flow.
